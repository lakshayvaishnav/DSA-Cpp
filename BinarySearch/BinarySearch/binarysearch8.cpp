A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
 If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, 
an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

	if(arr[0]>arr[1]) return 0;
	if(arr[n-1]>arr[n-2]) return n-1;

	int l = 1;
	int h = n-2;

	while(l<=h){
		int mid = (l+h)/2;
		if(arr[mid] > arr[mid+1] && arr[mid] > arr[mid-1]){
